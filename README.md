yahtzee clone using Qt libs
Code uploaded is currently broken. Can't upload the partialy fixed version since github stopped working again. Already spent to much time today sorting access via ssh and now its stopped working. No fukin idea why.
Re-added ssh key locally again which sorted the authentication problem again for now. The github would not allow me to push with out pull first, why? I have a remote git setup on my Linux box on local network and that does not create this issue.

Latest code works except for the settings dialog which is broken atm.
